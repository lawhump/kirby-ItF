# Into the Fold

IBM Design onboarding experience

## System Prerequisites
Kirby runs on PHP 5.4+, Apache or Nginx.

## Getting Started
### Seeing it locally

* Clone or download this repository
* In terminal, navigate to the project directory
* Run `php -S localhost:8000`
* In your browser of choice, go to localhost:8000

### Editing content locally
You can edit most copy from the Kirby panel. Because it's a one pager, it's broken down into sections. Some work will need to be done to make sure that not just anyone can go in and edit content. I believe someone on the team has experience with Kirby, and if not it's pretty decently documented.
* In terminal, navigate to the project directory
* Run `php -S localhost:8000`
* In your browser of choice, go to localhost:8000/panel

#### Formatting text
Kirby Supports Markdown. I know in some parts I don't think I enabled that, only allowing for unformatted text. The rules can be found [here](https://getkirby.com/docs/content/text).

### Documentation
